{"id":"rig-x44","title":"Refactor ZoteroMCPClient to native async","description":"## Problem\nThe ZoteroMCPClient uses asyncio.run() internally which conflicts with FastAPI's event loop.\nCurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor workaround in http_server.py - works but adds overhead.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n1. Make _call_tool_async the primary interface\n2. Remove asyncio.run() from call_tool\n3. Add proper async methods throughout client.py, proxy.py, workflows.py\n4. HTTP server can then call async methods directly\n\n## Benefits\n- No thread pool overhead\n- Proper async/await throughout\n- Better resource utilization\n- Cleaner code","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-21T18:14:46.003168+01:00","created_by":"thome","updated_at":"2026-01-21T18:19:12.43454+01:00"}
